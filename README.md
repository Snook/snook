### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I have been a PHP developer since 1999. I started programming as a hobby centered around creating and managing various gaming community websites, transitioned to full time developer in 2011.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git. I primarily used SVN but have dabbled with Github, as of Aug 2023, I have migrated our company's codebase from SVN to Github.
