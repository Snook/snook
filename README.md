### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My passion for web development began in 1999, fueled by a desire to create and manage dynamic online spaces. Starting as a hobbyist, I immersed myself in the world of PHP, building and maintaining websites for various gaming communities. This hands-on experience provided a solid foundation in the language and its capabilities.

In 2011, my passion turned into a full-fledged career. I transitioned from dedicated hobbyist to professional developer, leveraging my accumulated knowledge and experience to build complex web applications.
